# playWithPython
My Python projects I created for hobby

First of all, python must be installed in order for python codes to run on your computer.

In addition, there are libraries that must be installed in order for the codes I have submitted on this subject to work properly.

If it is not installed, you need to install the qrcode and PIL libraries from the command line with the pip install qrcode and pip install Pillow commands.
